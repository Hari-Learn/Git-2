In Linux, the home directory is used to store user profiles along with their personal files and settings. 
Typically, the root user (or system administrator) is responsible for creating new user accounts. 
When a new user is created, a corresponding directory is usually created under /home, which contains all the userâ€™s files, 
configurations, and personal data.
